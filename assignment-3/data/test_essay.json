In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty."},{"claims":[{"span":[1996,2047],"text":"computers have provided security and sophistication"},{"span":[801,945],"text":"Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it"},{"span":[957,1002],"text":"future prospects of computers are very bright"},{"span":[1344,1385],"text":"Computers have made humans over-dependent"}],"confirmation_bias":true,"id":61,"major_claim":[{"span":[2059,2101],"text":"dependence on computers is not a bad thing"},{"span":[244,342],"text":"The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"In the modern world , computers are used everywhere .

It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.\nFirst, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.\nSecond, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.\nMoreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.\nAll in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way."},{"claims":[{"span":[205,259],"text":"in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood"},{"span":[724,772],"text":"people are most creative when they were children"},{"span":[923,986],"text":"school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":218,"major_claim":[{"span":[147,196],"text":"childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"},{"span":[1327,1393],"text":"childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood .

Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. \nSecond, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.\nThird, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. \nIn short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government."},{"claims":[{"span":[2147,2187],"text":"teachers could improve their performance"},{"span":[2199,2237],"text":"schools are also improve their quality"},{"span":[976,1036],"text":"evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance"},{"span":[1052,1112],"text":"this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality"},{"span":[1563,1624],"text":"people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":289,"major_claim":[{"span":[423,474],"text":"students should be asked to evaluate their teachers"},{"span":[2085,2138],"text":"school should ask students to evaluate their teachers"},{"span":[2365,2426],"text":"there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance .

Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.\nAll advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school."},{"claims":[{"span":[166,238],"text":"the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system"},{"span":[947,1013],"text":"the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people"},{"span":[345,458],"text":"The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health"},{"span":[1060,1135],"text":"the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system"},{"span":[1692,1788],"text":"It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old"}],"confirmation_bias":true,"id":142,"major_claim":[{"span":[270,343],"text":"the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages"},{"span":[1617,1690],"text":"the development of the health care system helps people have a better life"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health .

In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. \nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area.

However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance.

Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.\nFirst of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \"a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction\". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.\nOn the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.\nTo conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution."},{"claims":[{"span":[357,517],"text":"Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice"},{"span":[1998,2135],"text":"Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages"},{"span":[534,594],"text":"if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study"},{"span":[1056,1108],"text":"people prone to work in two or three firms in a week"},{"span":[1445,1499],"text":"people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":310,"major_claim":[{"span":[227,281],"text":"Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal"},{"span":[1955,1996],"text":"people should work faster even more risky"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study .

I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice."},{"claims":[{"span":[1308,1376],"text":"our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present"},{"span":[299,549],"text":"This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes"},{"span":[890,1012],"text":"excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":68,"major_claim":[{"span":[91,191],"text":"it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media"},{"span":[1378,1490],"text":"What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences .

In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. \nFirst, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.\nSecond, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.\nHowever, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. \nIn conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life."},{"claims":[{"span":[659,707],"text":"it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus"},{"span":[1017,1130],"text":"with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not"},{"span":[1542,1572],"text":"a personal car uses is in need"}],"confirmation_bias":true,"id":255,"major_claim":[{"span":[501,551],"text":"there will be a decrease in cars use in the future"},{"span":[2294,2346],"text":"the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus .

Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.\nFirst of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars.

In this way, this won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years."},{"claims":[{"span":[1598,1641],"text":"Internet can be a useful tool for education"},{"span":[378,534],"text":"the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate"},{"span":[1004,1057],"text":"information from those sources is subject to question"},{"span":[1158,1222],"text":"it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can"}],"confirmation_bias":true,"id":119,"major_claim":[{"span":[1643,1704],"text":"at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate .

There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.\nFirstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.\nSecondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.\nThirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.\nAnd finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.\nTo sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail."},{"claims":[{"span":[369,438],"text":"it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help"},{"span":[2136,2188],"text":"many people decide to live alone for various reasons"},{"span":[2259,2343],"text":"it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help"},{"span":[440,486],"text":"Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money"},{"span":[965,1028],"text":"living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily"},{"span":[1569,1613],"text":"living with a roommate allows me to get help"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":154,"major_claim":[{"span":[319,351],"text":"I prefer to live with a roommate"},{"span":[2190,2241],"text":"I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money .

Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly.

For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.\nTo start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.\nWhat's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.\nSo, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time."},{"claims":[{"span":[222,278],"text":"The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors"},{"span":[293,351],"text":"they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists"},{"span":[1465,1527],"text":"They can benefit us financially by developing other industries"},{"span":[1539,1639],"text":"they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors"},{"span":[354,511],"text":"Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings"},{"span":[958,1056],"text":"Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city"}],"confirmation_bias":false,"id":322,"major_claim":[{"span":[1414,1463],"text":"we should preserve historic buildings in the city"},{"span":[92,220],"text":"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings .

At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.\nStudying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.\nAdditionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. \nTo conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group.

From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.\nIt is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.\nAlso, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.\nIn spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.\nTherefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.\n"},{"claims":[{"span":[565,705],"text":"children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years"},{"span":[1609,1692],"text":"the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages"}],"confirmation_bias":true,"id":355,"major_claim":[{"span":[456,548],"text":"it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten"},{"span":[1870,2000],"text":"if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children"}],"paragraphs":[{"text":"To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years .

Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.\nTo begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.\nIn conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children."}]
